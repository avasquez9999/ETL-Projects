### ETL PROJECTS
# Designed and implemented ETL and ELT pipelines using PgAdmin, PostgreSQL, and R studio.

# Project 1:# 
Extracted financial data from various sources. Then I loaded it into a temporary PostgreSQL table where I cleaned the data. Then I created a custom trading day calendar in Excel and loaded it into a table to help ensure that the trading data was complete. Then, I formatted and transformed the data and stored it in a materialized view for easy exportation to R studio. From there built a Markowitz nonconvex optimization model to help identify the 10 best stocks by risk and reward

# Project 2:#
Built a script that could scrap electricity load data from the NYISO website using R every few days and loaded the data into a Postgres database. Then cleaned and formatted the data so it could be used to create a forecasting model in R using TensorFlow API.
